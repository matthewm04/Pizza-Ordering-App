A little pizza ordering app I made using C++, the MFC, and Visual Studio GUI things

#######################################################################################

You can play around and pretend-order a pizza by getting the .exe file.

If you want to run this application, just build it in a recent version of Visual Studio and run it. Be sure to include all the files in this repo (except for the .exe) in the same folder and open the .sln file to build.

This was a project I made for my final in the same class as my elevator app. Because I only had a week, it has way less features and doesn't look at nice. But it works and who doesn't love pizza

It is supposed to be a non-functional version of a pizza ordering app. Just pretend you get the pizza you order and you will be happy.

Thanks for taking the time to go through my project! And feel free to let me know if there are any major issues (be nice please)
